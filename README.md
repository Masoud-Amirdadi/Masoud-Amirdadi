### Hi, I'm Masoud Amirdadi 👋

I'm a PhD student at the Lassonde School of Engineering, York University, working at the intersection of operations research, optimization, GIS, and machine learning.

I mostly build analytical tools, spatial models, and interactive maps to support decision-making and risk assessment for cases such as emergency response or wildfire.

Thanks for visiting my profile!
